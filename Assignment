Assignment:

Write a small parser for URL:s. The parser should return parsed values similar to ‘java.net.URL’ (but should not use it):
url = 'http://username:password@hostname/path?arg=value#anchor';
Should give:
Map
(
[scheme] => http
[host] => hostname
[user] => username
[pass] => password
[path] => /path
[query] => arg=value
[fragment] => anchor
)
Also write a parser for the [query] part, returning an array with the different values (not using the corresponding built-in function):
query = "key1=value1&key2=value2";
Should give:
Map
(
[key1] => value1
[key2] => value2
)
